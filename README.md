# 🛡️ Safe Code Executor

A secure Flask + Docker–based sandbox that runs **Python** and **JavaScript** code safely in isolated containers.

Safe Code Executor is a secure sandbox system that runs untrusted Python and JavaScript code inside isolated Docker containers.
It enforces strict security controls—timeout, memory limits, no network, and read-only filesystem—to ensure safe execution. Includes a simple web UI and execution history.

This guide shows **exactly how to run the project**, with **step-by-step instructions**, **command examples**, and **expected output** for every step.

## 📦 What Each Component Does

| Component             | Description                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **main.py**           | API `/run`, `/history`, `/ui`, validates input, saves history                    |
| **executor.py**       | Runs code safely inside Docker with limits (timeout, RAM, no network, read-only) |
| **index.html**        | UI (textarea + language selector + run button + output)                          |

## 🏗 System Architecture (5 Layers)

### **1️ UI (User Interface)**

* HTML textarea for writing code
* Language selector
* Sends `{ language, code }` to backend
* Displays output / errors

### **2️ Flask API**

* Validates:

  * Supported languages (`python`, `javascript`)
  * Code length ≤ **5000 chars**
* Saves execution history
* Sends code to Docker executor

### **3️ Secure Docker Sandbox**

* Executes untrusted code with:

  * `--network none` → No internet
  * `--read-only` → No file writes
  * `--memory=128m` → RAM limit
  * Timeout 10 sec
* Images:

  * Python → `python:3.11-slim`
  * JavaScript → `node:18-slim`

### **4️ Executor Module**

* Writes code to temporary file
* Mounts as read-only inside container
* Captures stdout, stderr, exit code

### **5️ History System**

* Stores last 10 runs in `history.json`
* Accessible via `/history`

---

## 🔁 Execution Flow

1. User writes code in UI
2. Browser sends POST → `/run`
3. Flask validates code
4. Code is written to temp file
5. Executor selects container (Python/JS)
6. Docker runs with security restrictions
7. Output/error returned to Flask
8. Added to history
9. Shown in UI

---

# 🔧 Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Docker Desktop
* WSL2 recommended
* Git

---

# 🚀 Getting Started (Step-by-Step)

---

## **1️⃣ Clone the Project**

```bash
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd Safe_Code_Executor
```

**Expected Output**

```
Cloning into 'Safe_Code_Executor'...
```

---

## **2️⃣ Create & Activate Virtual Environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Expected**

```
(venv)
```

---

## **3️⃣ Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Expected**

```
Successfully installed flask ...
```

---

## **4️⃣ Start Docker Daemon**

Open **Docker Desktop** → Wait for "Docker is running".

Optional test:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

---

## **5️⃣ Run the Flask Server**

```bash
python3 app/main.py
```

---

# 🧪 API Testing (Step-by-Step)

---

## **6️⃣ Health Check**

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

Expected:

```
Safe Code Executor API is running!
```

---

## **7️⃣ Run Python Code**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/run \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"language":"python","code":"print(2+2)"}'
```

```json
{"output":"4\n"}
```

---

## **8️⃣ Run JavaScript Code**
